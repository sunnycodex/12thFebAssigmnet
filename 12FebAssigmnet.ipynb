    "Q1. In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an error occurs, an exception object is created and Python stops executing the current code block, raises the exception and looks for an exception handler that can handle the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error is a type of error that occurs when the syntax of the code is incorrect, meaning that there is a problem with the structure of the code. Examples of syntax errors include missing a colon at the end of an if statement, or forgetting to close a parenthesis. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the code is executed and must be fixed before the code can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an exception is a type of error that occurs during the execution of a program, when something unexpected happens that prevents the program from continuing normally. Exceptions can be caused by a wide range of problems, such as trying to access a file that doesn't exist or dividing a number by zero. Exceptions are not detected by the Python interpreter before the code is executed, but instead are raised during the execution of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between a syntax error and an exception is that a syntax error is a problem with the structure of the code that prevents it from being executed, while an exception is an unexpected problem that occurs during the execution of the code."
